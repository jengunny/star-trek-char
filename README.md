This repository houses my first independent data analysis project.
This has to do with the categorical analysis of Star Trek characters.
Data is scraped from Wikipedia Main and Recurring Characters list.
Series focus is "The Cage" (TC, original pilot episode), The Original Series (TOS), The Next Generation (TNG), Deep Space 9 (DSN), Voyager (VOY), and Enterprise (ENT).
Tools used include Jupyter Notebook, ChatGPT, Cognos Analytics, and select python libraries.
